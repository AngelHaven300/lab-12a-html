The first thing I want people to see when they open my home
page is definitely a warm message on the top of the website in like a
banner. Im leaning towards either "Welcome to my website" or
"Welcome, Im Angel". Or even just my name would work "Angel Pena Bazan".
Im stuck between a font or designing a logo with my name. Then I would 
add a navigation bar that would have m "about me", "Contact me", 
"home", "portfolio", and "resume". Im thinking the banner would be a navy blue and 
the rest of the website will be a baby blue color. In the home page
I might design an animation or even just add a gif to cover the whole 
page. The font would be in Bauhaus 93 and Cascadia Code.
